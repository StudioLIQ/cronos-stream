# Port
# - Railway injects PORT automatically
# - This app also supports API_PORT, but it's not required on Railway

# Database
# - Recommended on Railway: add a Railway MySQL service and LINK it to the API service.
#   Railway will inject MYSQL_URL and/or MYSQLHOST/MYSQLPORT/MYSQLUSER/MYSQLPASSWORD/MYSQLDATABASE.
# - If you want everything managed via this file instead, set one of the options below.
#
# Option A (preferred)
# DATABASE_URL=mysql://stream402:stream402@127.0.0.1:3307/stream402
#
# Option B
# DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
# DB_PORT=3307
# DB_USER=stream402
# DB_PASSWORD=stream402
# DB_NAME=stream402

# Optional: Membership NFT integration
